\begin_layout Abstract
Artificial neural networks have proven to be an important machine learning
 model that has been widely used in recent decades in a number of difficult
 problems of classification or data fitting from real - world areas.
 Due to their importance, a number of techniques have been developed that
 efficiently identify the parameter vector for these models.
 These techniques usually come from the field of optimization and, by minimizing
 the training error of artificial neural networks, estimate the vector of
 their parameters.
 However, many times these techniques either get trapped in local minima
 of the training error or lead to overfitting the artificial neural network,
 resulting in poor performance when applied to data that was not present
 during the training process.
 This paper presents an innovative training technique for artificial neural
 networks based on the Differential Evolution optimization method.
 This new technique creates an initial population of artificial neural networks
 that evolve and periodically applies a local optimization technique in
 order to accelerate the training of these networks.
 The application of the local minimization technique is done in such a way
 as to avoid the phenomenon of overfitting.
 This new method was successfully applied to a series of classification
 and data fitting problems and a comparative study was made with other training
 techniques from the relevant literature.

In the current work a series of modifications are incorporated in the DE
 method in order to efficient train artificial neural networks.
 Among these modifications one finds the periodic and controlled application
 of a local optimization method to randomly selected neural networks from
 the population of the DE method.
 The application of the local technique is done by ensuring that the parameters
 of the neural network remain within a specific value range, thus avoiding,
 to the extent possible, any overfitting that could occur.
 Furthermore, in the modifications there is a termination rule that, on
 the one hand, is based on stochastic observations regarding the evolution
 of the population of the DE method and, on the other hand, uses the special
 characteristics of the error function of the artificial neural network.
 The DE method was chosen among other evolutionary techniques for the simplicity
 of its implementation, for the small number of parameters that the user
 must specify compared to other evolutionary techniques, as well as for
 the large number of applications in which it has been applied.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The proposed method could be also applied on deep neural networks used in
 the recent literature 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "nn_deep1,nn_deep2"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, since it is an evolutionary technique that requires the use of
 many candidate solutions that must evolve over time, this method will significa
ntly increase the execution time in such models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The key elements introduced by the new method are the use of a modified
 evolutionary technique that has been shown to be useful for finding the
 global minimum of functions.
 This method effectively explores the parameter space of the artificial
 neural network and periodically applies local optimization to randomly
 selected candidate solutions, without significantly departing from their
 identified values.
 In this way, it seeks to prevent the artificial neural network from being
 driven into a state of overfitting and losing any generalization capabilities
 it possesses.

\begin_layout Standard
The Differential Evolution method involves a series of candidate solutions
 called agents.
 These agents evolve through a series of iterations aiming to obtain the
 global minimum of the corresponding objective function.
 In the present method, each agent also constitutes a vector of parameters
 of an artificial neural network and the objective function to be minimized
 is the error function presented previously.
 The neural networks used in the current work are expressed through the
 equation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{H}w_{(d+2)i-(d+1)}\sigma\left(\sum_{j=1}^{d}x_{j}w_{(d+2)i-(d+1)+j}+w_{(d+2)i}\right)\label{eq:nn}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

that was initially suggested in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "nnc"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The constant 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 denotes the number of processing units for the neural network and the constant
 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 stands for the number of elements in the input pattern 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{x}$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, the number of elements in the parameter vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{w}$
\end_inset

 are calculated as 
\begin_inset Formula $n=\left(d+2\right)H$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The proposed technique starts with a series of randomly selected parameter
 vectors for the artificial neural network.
 In the terminology of the differential evolution technique, these vectors
 are called agents.
 These agents evolve iteratively and in each iteration a small number of
 them are randomly selected for the application of a local optimization
 method.
 The application of the local optimization method is done in such a way
 that its result is in a range of values that is not far from the value
 that has already been identified by the evolutionary technique.
 In this way, an attempt is made to avoid the phenomenon of overfitting
 since the parameter values cannot deviate significantly from the values
 that have already been identified by the evolutionary technique.
 Finally, the evolutionary technique is terminated by applying a termination
 rule based on the difference from iteration to iteration in the sum of
 the fitness values of agents.
 If this sum no longer changes, then it is very likely that the method should
 be terminated.
 The main steps of the proposed method are as follows:

A series of experiments were carried out to determine the effectiveness
 of the proposed technique and its ability to achieve low generalization
 errors in classification and data fitting problems.
 In addition, a series of experiments were performed to determine the stability
 of the method when critical parameters take different values.
 In order to perform the experiments a series of classification and regression
 datasets from the relevant literature was obtained.
 These datasets cover a wide range of real - world applications, such as
 medicine, physics, earth quakes, economy, signal processing etc.
 These datasets can be found in the following websites:

 Every experiment was repeated 30 times, using different seed for the random
 number generator each time.
 For the validation of the experiments the 10 - fold cross validation technique
 was incorporated.
 The machine used in the experiments was an AMD Ryzen 5950X with 128GB of
 ram, running Debian Linux as the operating system.
 The values for the parameters of the proposed method are listed in Table

The specific values for the parameters were chosen so that there is a compromise
 between the speed of the proposed method and its efficiency.
 However, a series of experiments are presented below in which various experimen
tal parameters were modified, in order to determine the stability of the
 proposed technique to possible changes in these parameters.

The used formula for the classification error is:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{C}\left(M(x)\right)=100\times\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(\mbox{class}\left(M\left(x_{i}\right)\right)-y_{i}\right)}{N}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $M(x)$
\end_inset

 denotes the used model and the set 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 represents the train dataset.

\series bold
 
\series default
Likewise, the regression error is defined as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{R}\left(M(x)\right)=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(M\left(x_{i}\right)-y_{i}\right)^{2}}{N}
\end{equation}

 evaluates the error rates of various machine learning models across multiple
 classification datasets.
 Each row corresponds to a dataset, and each column represents a specific
 model.
 The values indicate the error percentages, where lower values signify better
 performance.
 The last row provides the average error rate for each model, offering an
 overall performance summary.
 Starting with the averages, the NEURALDE model exhibits the best overall
 performance, achieving the lowest mean error rate of 19.78%.
 It is followed by GENETIC with an average error rate of 26.19% and RBF at
 30.08%.
 The PRUNE model achieves an average error rate of 28.39%, placing it between
 RBF and NEAT, which has an average error rate of 32.66%.
 Meanwhile, BFGS and ADAM display the highest average error rates, 33.43%
 and 35.88%, respectively, making NEURALDE the most efficient model among
 those compared.
 On a dataset-specific level, NEURALDE consistently delivers the lowest
 error rates in numerous cases.
 For instance, in the ALCOHOL dataset, NEURALDE achieves the best result
 with an error rate of 19.15%, while PRUNE follows closely with 15.75%, outperform
ing all other models.
 In the CIRCULAR dataset, NEURALDE outperforms all other models with an
 error rate of 4.23%, while PRUNE records a slightly higher error rate of
 12.76%, still surpassing many other methods.
 In datasets like MAGIC and MAMMOGRAPHIC, NEURALDE again proves superior,
 with error rates of 11.73% and 17.52%, respectively.
 PRUNE, however, shows significant variability; for example, it records
 30.76% in MAGIC, which is higher than GENETIC (21.75%), but still manages
 competitive performance in MAMMOGRAPHIC with 38.10%.
 There are, however, a few datasets where NEURALDE does not perform as dominantl
y.
 For example, in the HOUSEVOTES dataset, it ties with other models at 7.48%.
 PRUNE performs better here with an error rate of 5.81%, showcasing its strengths
 in specific datasets.
 Similarly, in the ZONF_S dataset, NEURALDE achieves 2.41%, while PRUNE closely
 follows with 3.27%.
 Despite this, NEURALDE's superior consistency across datasets remains evident.
 Other models, such as GENETIC, show strong performance in isolated cases,
 such as in the SPIRAL dataset (48.66%).
 However, they generally fall short of NEURALDE’s consistent excellence.
 RBF demonstrates strong stability, with notable results in the DERMATOLOGY
 (62.34%) and PHONEME (23.32%) datasets, but PRUNE again outshines RBF in
 specific cases like DERMATOLOGY with an error rate of 9.02%.
 Meanwhile, ADAM and BFGS tend to underperform, particularly in datasets
 like SPAMBASE, where they record high error rates of 48.05% and 18.16%, respectiv
ely.
 PRUNE outperforms them significantly in SPAMBASE with an error rate of
 just 3.91%, illustrating its competitiveness in certain scenarios.In conclusion,
 the NEURALDE model stands out as the most effective model overall, achieving
 the lowest average error rate and excelling in the majority of datasets.
 PRUNE emerges as a strong contender, with competitive performance and notable
 success in certain datasets.
 While other models, such as RBF and GENETIC, perform well in specific scenarios
, NEURALDE demonstrates superior consistency and effectiveness across a
 wide range of datasets, with PRUNE providing significant value in enhancing
 classification accuracy in many cases.

 This result suggests that the model consistently performs well across most
 datasets.
 PRUNE follows as the second-best model, with an average error of 15.40,
 outperforming GENETIC, RBF, and other methods in several cases.
 GENETIC and RBF achieve average errors of 9.29 and 9.91, respectively.
 ADAM, NEAT, and BFGS exhibit higher average errors, at 22.47, 24.35, and
 30.31 respectively, indicating lower performance compared to the other models.
 Analyzing the results dataset by dataset, NEURALDE records the smallest
 error in several cases.
 For instance, in the AIRFOIL dataset, it achieves an error of 0.0014, outperform
ing all other models.
 PRUNE also shows strong performance here, with an error of 0.002, close
 to NEURALDE.
 In the CONCRETE dataset, NEURALDE achieves the lowest error of 0.003, while
 PRUNE achieves the second-lowest error of 0.0077, further confirming its
 reliability.
 Similarly, in the LASER dataset, NEURALDE delivers an exceptionally low
 error of 0.0026, followed closely by PRUNE with an error of 0.007.
 In the TREASURY dataset, NEURALDE demonstrates superior performance with
 an error of 1.021, better than all other models, while PRUNE also achieves
 a competitive error of 13.76, outperforming NEAT and ADAM.
 PRUNE shows notable performance in several datasets where it surpasses
 other models.
 For instance, in the STOCK dataset, PRUNE records an error of 39.08, which
 is lower than NEAT (215.82) and ADAM (180.89), though slightly higher than
 NEURALDE (3.40).
 In the BASEBALL dataset, PRUNE achieves 94.50, outperforming ADAM (77.90)
 and NEAT (100.39).
 In the MORTGAGE dataset, PRUNE achieves an error of 12.96, which, while
 not the lowest, still outperforms several other models including NEAT (14.11)
 and ADAM (9.24).
 Overall, while NEURALDE stands out as the most effective model, PRUNE emerges
 as a highly competitive alternative, consistently delivering strong results
 across multiple datasets.
 GENETIC and RBF also perform well in specific cases, but their performance
 is less consistent compared to NEURALDE and PRUNE.
 ADAM, NEAT, and BFGS generally underperform relative to the other methods.

, the comparison of the proposed machine learning model NEURALDE with other
 models for classification datasets is illustrated, based on the values
 of the critical parameter p, which indicate the levels of statistical significa
nce.
 The results show exceptionally low p-values, suggesting that the differences
 in the performance of NEURALDE compared to other models are not random
 and are statistically highly significant.
 Specifically, the comparison of NEURALDE with ADAM yielded p=4.7e-08, with
 BFGS p=1e−10, with GENETIC p=2.9e−09, with NEAT p=2.3e−10, with RBF p=1.3e−08,
 and with PRUNE p=5.8e−08.
 These values are well below the common thresholds of significance (p<0.05
 : significant), indicating that the superiority of NEURALDE is statistically
 well-founded.
 The results confirm the high efficiency of the proposed model compared
 to other machine learning methods, demonstrating its reliability and effectiven
ess in classification problems.

Experiments with the differential weight 
\end_layout

 on the accuracy of the proposed technique.
 For this reason the following methods for the calculation of the differential
 weight (parameter

The table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 provides the performance of three differential weight computation methods
 (MIGRANT, ADAPTIVE, and RANDOM) on the series of classification datasets.
 The analysis reveals that the MIGRANT method achieves the smallest average
 error rate of 19.34%, indicating the best overall performance among the
 three methods.
 The RANDOM method follows closely with an average error rate of 19.78%,
 while the ADAPTIVE method has the highest average error rate of 19.98%,
 suggesting it is the least effective on average.
 Examining individual datasets, MIGRANT outperforms the other methods in
 several cases.
 For example, in the HEART dataset, MIGRANT records an error rate of 19.01%,
 better than ADAPTIVE (17.29%) and RANDOM (17.60%).
 Similarly, in the MAGIC dataset, MIGRANT achieves a competitive error rate
 of 11.83%, which is close to RANDOM (11.73%) but higher than ADAPTIVE (11.28%).
 MIGRANT also has the lowest error in datasets such as ALCOHOL (19.62%),
 REGIONS2 (26.26%), and SPAMBASE (5.87%).
 ADAPTIVE demonstrates strong performance in specific datasets, achieving
 the lowest error rates in cases such as MAGIC (11.28%) and HEART (17.29%).
 However, in many datasets, it performs worse than MIGRANT or RANDOM, such
 as in SPAMBASE, where it records a lower error rate of 4.78% but is generally
 outperformed in other critical datasets.
 The RANDOM method exhibits competitive performance in several datasets,
 achieving the lowest error rates in examples like ZOO (6.63%) and ZONF_S
 (2.41%).
 However, its performance fluctuates more significantly, with higher error
 rates in datasets such as HEARTATTACK (19.70%) and REGIONS2 (28.77%), where
 it is outperformed by MIGRANT and ADAPTIVE.
 Notable observations include cases where the error rates are very close
 across the methods, such as in datasets like CIRCULAR, where the differences
 are minimal (MIGRANT at 4.28%, ADAPTIVE at 4.34%, and RANDOM at 4.23%).
 In other cases, the differences are more pronounced, as in SEGMENT, where
 MIGRANT achieves 9.71%, significantly better than ADAPTIVE (15.99%) and RANDOM
 (15.60%).
 Overall, MIGRANT demonstrates the most consistent and robust performance
 across the datasets, with the lowest average error and competitive results
 in many individual datasets.
 RANDOM and ADAPTIVE have comparable average errors but show more variability
 in their performance.

The Table

 presents the performance of three differential weight computation methods
 (MIGRANT, ADAPTIVE, and RANDOM) on the regression datasets.
 The RANDOM method achieves the lowest average error, 5.56, making it the
 most effective overall.
 ADAPTIVE follows with an average error of 6.23, while MIGRANT exhibits the
 highest average error at 8.03, indicating the least effective performance.
 For specific datasets, RANDOM often outperforms the others.
 For instance, in the HOUSING dataset, it records an error of 24.82, lower
 than MIGRANT (14.58) and ADAPTIVE (32.62).
 Similarly, in the PLASTIC dataset, RANDOM achieves the smallest error of
 3.27 compared to MIGRANT (5.36) and ADAPTIVE (3.57).
 RANDOM also shows superior performance in datasets like MORTGAGE (0.54)
 and STOCK (3.4).
 ADAPTIVE demonstrates strong performance in certain datasets, such as FRIEDMAN,
 where its error is 1.32, outperforming MIGRANT (1.66) and RANDOM (1.22).
 In the QUAKE dataset, ADAPTIVE records the lowest error of 0.041.
 However, its performance is noticeably weaker in other datasets, like HOUSING,
 where it registers the highest error of the three.
 MIGRANT outperforms in a few cases, such as the BL dataset, where its error
 is 0.007, significantly lower than ADAPTIVE (0.019) and RANDOM (0.016).
 However, it generally records higher errors in many datasets, such as AUTO
 (45.37) and BASEBALL (79.24), where the other methods perform better.
 In some cases, such as the LASER dataset, all methods perform similarly,
 with errors of 0.0026 for MIGRANT and RANDOM, and 0.0027 for ADAPTIVE.
 In the QUAKE dataset, the differences are also minimal, with RANDOM having
 the highest error (0.042), but very close to the others.
 Overall, RANDOM emerges as the most reliable and effective method, with
 the lowest average error and frequent superiority across individual datasets.
 ADAPTIVE performs well in selected datasets but shows greater variability,
 while MIGRANT demonstrates the least effective performance, with higher
 errors across numerous datasets.

\begin_layout Standard
An analysis was conducted to compare different methods for computing differentia
l weights in a proposed machine learning approach, focusing on classification
 error.
 The analysis employed the Wilcoxon Test for pairwise comparisons and was
 applied to the classification datasets.
 The goal was to examine whether statistically significant differences exist
 among the three approaches: MIGRANT, ADAPTIVE, and RANDOM Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:statFclass"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The results showed that the comparison between MIGRANT and ADAPTIVE yielded
 a p-value of 0.085.
 Although this value suggests a trend of differentiation, it does not fall
 below the conventional significance threshold of 0.05, indicating that the
 difference is not statistically significant.
 Similarly, the comparison between MIGRANT and RANDOM produced a p-value
 of 0.064, which, while closer to significance, also does not meet the required
 threshold.
 Finally, the comparison between ADAPTIVE and RANDOM resulted in a p-value
 of 0.23, indicating no statistically significant difference between these
 two methods.
 Overall, the findings suggest that while there are indications of differences
 in behavior among the three approaches, none of these differences are statistic
ally significant based on the data analyzed.
 This implies that the three methods for computing differential weights
 may be considered equivalent in terms of their impact on classification
 error, at least for the datasets used in this study.

An analysis was conducted to compare different methods for calculating different
ial weight in the proposed machine learning approach on the regression datasets.
 The Wilcoxon Test was used for pairwise comparisons, applied across the
 series of regression datasets, with a focus on regression error.
 The aim was to determine the statistical significance of the observed differenc
es between the methods Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:statFRegression"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The results showed that the comparison between MIGRANT and ADAPTIVE yielded
 a p-value of 0.68, indicating no statistically significant difference between
 these two methods.
 Similarly, the comparison between MIGRANT and RANDOM resulted in a p-value
 of 0.9, confirming the absence of a statistically significant difference
 in this case as well.
 However, the comparison between ADAPTIVE and RANDOM produced a p-value
 of 0.00095, which is below the standard threshold for statistical significance
 (commonly 0.05).
 This suggests a statistically significant difference between these two
 approaches.
 Overall, the findings indicate that the MIGRANT and ADAPTIVE methods, as
 well as the MIGRANT and RANDOM methods, exhibit similar performance regarding
 regression error.
 In contrast, the ADAPTIVE method shows a clear and statistically significant
 differentiation from the RANDOM method.

\begin_layout Standard
In the next series of experiments, the effect of the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 on the behavior of the method on classification and data fitting data was
 studied.
 In this series of experiments, different values of this parameter were
 studied.
 This parameter determines the allowable range of values within which the
 local minimization method can vary the parameters of the artificial neural
 network.

\begin_layout Standard
The Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 presents error percentages across the used classification datasets for
 different values of the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 (1.25, 1.5, 2, 4, and 8).
 The lowest overall average error is observed for 
\begin_inset Formula $a=2$
\end_inset

 with an average of 19.78%.
 This suggests that 
\begin_inset Formula $a=2$
\end_inset

 provides the most balanced performance across datasets.
 The other parameter values—1.25, 1.5, 4, and 8—yield average errors of 19.98%,
 19.95%, 20.00%, and 19.95%, respectively.
 These results indicate that 
\begin_inset Formula $a=2$
\end_inset

 has a slight advantage in minimizing the overall error compared to other
 values.
 For individual datasets, the performance varies depending on the parameter
 value.
 For example, in the ALCOHOL dataset, the smallest error is achieved at
 
\begin_inset Formula $a=2$
\end_inset

 with 19.15%, while other values result in slightly higher errors.
 Similarly, in the SEGMENT dataset, the error is minimized at 
\begin_inset Formula $a=8$
\end_inset

 with 14.27%.
 However, in datasets like SPIRAL, the errors across all parameter values
 are close, with no significant advantage for any specific value.
 In certain datasets, there is a clear trend in error reduction as the parameter
 value changes.
 For example, in the SEGMENT dataset, errors decrease consistently from
 
\begin_inset Formula $a=1.25$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $a=8$
\end_inset

.
 Conversely, in the ZOO dataset, the error decreases for lower values of
 a but increases again at higher values, indicating that performance is
 not always linear with changes in 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

.
 Some datasets exhibit minimal variability in performance across parameter
 values.
 For example, the error for the LIVERDISORDER dataset remains relatively
 stable, ranging from 31.41% to 32.33%.
 Similarly, the SPIRAL dataset shows little variation, with errors consistently
 around 42%.
 In other cases, specific parameter values consistently underperform.
 For instance, in the Z_F_S dataset, 
\begin_inset Formula $a=1.5$
\end_inset

 achieves the lowest error of 6.67%, while 
\begin_inset Formula $a=2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a=4$
\end_inset

 result in slightly higher errors.
 Similarly, 
\begin_inset Formula $a=8$
\end_inset

 achieves the smallest error for certain datasets like SEGMENT but performs
 poorly for datasets like WINE.
 Overall, 
\begin_inset Formula $a=2$
\end_inset

 emerges as the most effective parameter value, yielding the smallest average
 error across datasets.
 While other values of 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 perform well in individual cases, their overall performance is less consistent.

\end_inset

 presents error rates for the regression datasets across different values
 of the critical parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 (1.25, 1.5, 2, 4, and 8).
 The lowest average error is observed for 
\begin_inset Formula $a=1.5$
\end_inset

, with an average of 5.39, suggesting it offers the best overall performance.
 
\begin_inset Formula $a=1.25$
\end_inset

 ranks second with an average of 5.46, and 
\begin_inset Formula $a=2$
\end_inset

 slightly higher at 5.56.
 The values 
\begin_inset Formula $a=4$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a=8$
\end_inset

 show a marked increase in errors, with averages of 5.94 and 7.44, respectively.
 This indicates that higher values of 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 are less effective compared to smaller ones.
 For individual datasets, performance varies with the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

.
 For instance, in the AIRFOIL dataset, the error consistently decreases
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 increases, with the smallest error (0.0007) observed at 
\begin_inset Formula $a=8$
\end_inset

.
 Conversely, in the FRIEDMAN dataset, the error rises sharply at 
\begin_inset Formula $a=8$
\end_inset

 (19.74), signaling a significant performance decline.
 In some datasets, such as BASEBALL, the error steadily increases with higher
 values of 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 rising from 57.67 at a=1.25 to 72.37 at 
\begin_inset Formula $a=8$
\end_inset

.
 In contrast, in the HOUSING dataset, the smallest error occurs at 
\begin_inset Formula $a=4$
\end_inset

 (22.86), although larger values like 
\begin_inset Formula $a=8$
\end_inset

 show only a slight increase.
 Certain datasets exhibit minimal sensitivity to changes in 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

.
 For example, in the LASER dataset, errors remain almost constant regardless
 of the parameter value, ranging from 0.0025 to 0.0035.
 Similarly, in the DEE dataset, the errors are nearly identical across all
 values of 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 showing minimal variation.
 Interestingly, the PLASTIC dataset shows a gradual decrease in error from
 3.37 at a=1.25 to 2.8 at a=8, indicating improved performance with increasing
 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

.
 Conversely, in the STOCK dataset, the error increases significantly from
 2.82 at a=1.25 to 5.42 at 
\begin_inset Formula $a=8$
\end_inset

.
 In conclusion, 
\begin_inset Formula $a=1.5$
\end_inset

 emerges as the optimal choice for minimizing overall error in this analysis.
 Higher values of 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 demonstrate reduced effectiveness, especially at 
\begin_inset Formula $a=8$
\end_inset

, where the average error rises notably.
 However, the results reveal that the impact of 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 varies by dataset, with some benefiting from smaller values and others
 exhibiting relative insensitivity to parameter changes.

\begin_layout Standard
In Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, a comparison of various values of the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 which defines the bounds of optimal values in the proposed machine learning
 method, is presented.
 The comparisons were conducted using the Wilcoxon Test across the series
 of used datasets to evaluate the classification error.
 The results indicate that the p-values for all pairwise comparisons between
 different values of 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 are above the significance level of 0.05, suggesting no statistically significan
t differences.
 For instance, comparisons between 
\begin_inset Formula $a=1.25$
\end_inset

 and other values (1.5, 2, 4, 8) yielded p-values ranging from 0.6 to 0.73,
 while comparisons between 
\begin_inset Formula $a=1.5$
\end_inset

 and other values (2, 4, 8) produced p-values ranging from 0.32 to 0.8.
 Similarly, comparisons between 
\begin_inset Formula $a=2$
\end_inset

 and higher values (4 and 8) resulted in p-values of 0.22 and 0.31, respectively,
 whereas the comparison between 
\begin_inset Formula $a=4$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a=8$
\end_inset

 yielded a p-value of 0.69.
 In conclusion, the results suggest that variations in the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 within the specified range do not lead to statistically significant differences
 in classification error, as all p-values remain well above the conventional
 significance threshold.
 Therefore, the choice of a specific value for 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 is likely to have little or no impact on the method's performance, based
 on the current data.

\begin_layout Standard
In Figure

\end_inset

, the comparison of different values of parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 for the regression error is presented.
 The results showed that statistically significant differences were observed
 in some comparisons, as the p-values were below the significance level
 of 0.05.
 For example, the comparison between 
\begin_inset Formula $a=1.25$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a=4$
\end_inset

 yielded p=0.024, while between 
\begin_inset Formula $a=1.25$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a=8$
\end_inset

, p=0.017 was observed.
 Similarly, the comparison between 
\begin_inset Formula $a=1.5$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a=8$
\end_inset

 resulted in p=0.0021, indicating strong statistical significance.
 Conversely, some comparisons did not show statistically significant differences
, as the p-values were above the significance level.
 For instance, the comparison between 
\begin_inset Formula $a=2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a=4$
\end_inset

 yielded p=0.22, while the comparison between 
\begin_inset Formula $a=1.25$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a=2$
\end_inset

 resulted in p=0.15.
 In conclusion, the results suggest that the choice of parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 affects the regression error in certain cases, with statistically significant
 differences primarily observed in comparisons between smaller and larger
 values of the parameter.
 However, the differences are not always consistent and depend on the specific
 combinations of values being compared.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Experiments with the local search rate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the last series of experiments, the effect of the execution rate of local
 optimization methods was studied.
 For this reason, values ranging from 0.25% to 2% were studied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:experPLClass"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 provides error rates for the used classification datasets under different
 values of periodic local search 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}$
\end_inset

 (0.0025, 0.005, 0.01, and 0.02).
 The analysis reveals that the lowest average error is observed 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.02$
\end_inset

, with an error rate of 19.43%, suggesting that this value yields the best
 overall performance.
 This is closely followed by 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.01$
\end_inset

 with an average error of 19.66% and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.005$
\end_inset

 with 19.78%.
 The highest average error occurs at 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.0025$
\end_inset

 with 20.48%, indicating comparatively poorer performance.
 Examining individual datasets, the impact of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}$
\end_inset

 varies.
 For instance, in the ALCOHOL dataset, the smallest error is observed at
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.02$
\end_inset

 with 16.49%, whereas larger values such as 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.01$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.005$
\end_inset

 result in higher errors (21.81% and 19.15%, respectively).
 Conversely, in the SEGMENT dataset, the error consistently decreases as
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}$
\end_inset

 increases, reaching its lowest value at 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.02$
\end_inset

 with 11.70%.
 This trend is also evident in datasets such as SPAMBASE and WINE, where
 the errors decrease significantly with higher 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}$
\end_inset

 values.
 Some datasets exhibit minimal sensitivity to changes in 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}$
\end_inset

.
 For example, in the HEART and LIVERDISORDER datasets, the error rates remain
 relatively stable across all 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}$
\end_inset

 values, showing only marginal fluctuations.
 In other cases, such as CIRCULAR and HOUSEVOTES, the variations in error
 rates are similarly minor.
 However, certain datasets show exceptions to the general trend.
 For example, in the SONAR dataset, the error rate is lowest at 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.02$
\end_inset

 with 18.53%, but higher 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}$
\end_inset

 values like 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.01$
\end_inset

 produce increased errors (20.38%).
 Similarly, the REGIONS2 dataset achieves its best performance at 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.02$
\end_inset

 with an error rate of 28.02%, but other 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}$
\end_inset

 values yield comparable results, such as 28.77% at both 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.005$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.01$
\end_inset

.
 The data suggests that higher 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}$
\end_inset

 values, particularly 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.02$
\end_inset

, generally result in improved performance across most datasets.
 Nevertheless, the optimal 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}$
\end_inset

 value may vary depending on specific dataset characteristics, and some
 datasets show negligible or inconsistent responses to changes in 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}$
\end_inset

.
 Overall, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.02$
\end_inset

 is recommended for achieving the lowest average error.

\begin_layout Standard
The Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:experPlRegression"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 presents error rates for the used regression datasets under different values
 of periodic local search 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}$
\end_inset

 (0.0025, 0.005, 0.01, and 0.02).
 The analysis indicates that the lowest average error is observed at 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.01$
\end_inset

 with a value of 5.04, suggesting that this setting offers the best overall
 performance.
 This is followed by 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.02$
\end_inset

 with an average error of 5.10, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.005$
\end_inset

 with 5.56, and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.0025$
\end_inset

 with 6.34, which has the highest average error and the poorest performance.
 Examining individual datasets reveals variations in the impact of different
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}$
\end_inset

 values.
 In the AUTO dataset, the error decreases steadily as 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}$
\end_inset

 increases, dropping from 17.63 at 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.0025$
\end_inset

 to its lowest point of 10.11 at 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.02$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly, in the HOUSING dataset, the error significantly reduces from
 32.72 at 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.0025$
\end_inset

 to 14.02 at 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.02$
\end_inset

.
 This decreasing trend is also evident in other datasets, such as MORTGAGE,
 where the error falls from 1.22 at 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.0025$
\end_inset

 to just 0.032 at 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.02$
\end_inset

, and STOCK, where the error reduces from 6.58 to 1.47.
 In some datasets, the 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}$
\end_inset

 parameter has minimal impact.
 For instance, in the CONCRETE dataset, the error remains constant across
 all 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}$
\end_inset

 values at 0.003.
 Similar stability is observed in the QUAKE and SN datasets, where variations
 are minimal.
 However, some datasets exhibit less predictable trends.
 In the BASEBALL dataset, the error initially decreases from 63.05 at 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.0025$
\end_inset

 to 60.56 at 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.005$
\end_inset

, but then increases again to 71.93 at 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.02$
\end_inset

.
 Similar inconsistent results are observed in the PY and BL datasets.
 Overall, the analysis suggests that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.01$
\end_inset

 delivers the best average performance.
 Nevertheless, the effect of the 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}$
\end_inset

 parameter varies across datasets, with some benefiting more from higher
 or lower 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}$
\end_inset

 values.

, the pairwise comparisons using the Wilcoxon Test are presented to examine
 the impact of different values of the local optimization parameter (
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}$
\end_inset

) on the proposed machine learning method, based on a series of well-known
 datasets, with the aim of evaluating the classification error.
 The Wilcoxon Test results showed that comparisons between 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.0025$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.005$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.01$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.02$
\end_inset

 demonstrated statistically significant differences, as the p-values were
 lower than the significance level of 0.05.
 Specifically, the p-value for the comparison between 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.0025$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.005$
\end_inset

 was 0.0001, between 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.0025$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.01$
\end_inset

 was 0.00034, and between 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.0025$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.02$
\end_inset

 was 0.00048.
 Conversely, the comparisons between 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.005$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.01$
\end_inset

, as well as between 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.01$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.02$
\end_inset

, did not show statistically significant differences, with p-values of 0.21
 and 0.57, respectively.
 The comparison between 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.005$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.02$
\end_inset

 yielded a p-value of 0.052, indicating a marginal lack of significance.
 Overall, the results suggest that the choice of the pl parameter value
 affects the classification error primarily in comparisons involving the
 value 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.0025$
\end_inset

, while the other comparisons do not exhibit clear statistically significant
 differences.

 In the comparisons between

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.005$

 did not show statistically significant differences, with p-values of 0.12,
 0.18, 0.22, and 0.097, respectively, all of which are above the significance
 level of 0.05.
 Finally, the comparison between 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.01$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.02$
\end_inset

 yielded a p-value of 0.086, which is close to but above the significance
 level of 0.05, suggesting borderline non-significance.
 Overall, the results indicate that only the comparison between 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.0025$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.005$
\end_inset

 showed a statistically significant difference, while the remaining comparisons

\end_inset

 regarding the local search methods BFGS, LBFGS, and ADAM for the NEURALDE
 model presents their performance on classification datasets, with the values
 representing error percentages.
 According to the results, the BFGS method achieves the lowest average error
 rate at 19.78%, followed by LBFGS with 20.06% and ADAM with 21.48%.
 This highlights the relative superiority of BFGS in minimizing error compared
 to the other methods.
 When analyzing individual datasets, BFGS records the lowest error rates
 in several cases.
 For instance, in the HOUSEVOTES dataset, both BFGS and LBFGS yield similar
 results, while ADAM shows the lowest error at 5.39%.
 In the SPAMBASE dataset, ADAM outperforms the others with an error rate
 of 3.91%, compared to 4.95% and 4.78% for BFGS and LBFGS, respectively.
 Similarly, in the STUDENT dataset, ADAM performs best with the lowest error
 at 3.82%.
 However, in datasets like SEGMENT, BFGS excels with a significantly lower
 error of 15.60% compared to 19.46% for LBFGS and 27.47% for ADAM.
 Notable differences are observed in datasets such as DERMATOLOGY, where
 LBFGS records the lowest error at 9.09%, compared to 10.38% for BFGS and
 11.34% for ADAM.
 In the MAGIC dataset, BFGS and LBFGS deliver comparable performance, with
 error rates of 11.73% and 11.83%, respectively, while ADAM presents a higher
 error of 12.72%.
 Similarly, in the CIRCULAR dataset, BFGS achieves the lowest error at 4.23%,
 closely followed by LBFGS at 4.29%, and ADAM at 4.52%.
 Overall, BFGS demonstrates superior performance in most cases, maintaining
 the lowest variation in error rates and achieving the smallest average
 error.
 However, LBFGS delivers competitive results with slightly higher average
 error and outperforms in specific datasets like DERMATOLOGY.
 While ADAM records lower error rates in isolated datasets such as SPAMBASE
 and STUDENT, it exhibits a higher overall error, indicating greater variability
 in its performance.
 In conclusion, the BFGS method emerges as the most efficient overall, while
 LBFGS offers consistently competitive performance.
 ADAM shows advantages in certain datasets but has a higher overall average
 error rate.

 highlights the performance of the local search methods BFGS, LBFGS, and
 ADAM applied to regression datasets within the NEURALDE model.
 The reported values correspond to absolute errors.
 Among the three methods, BFGS achieves the lowest mean error of 5.56, demonstrat
ing a clear advantage over LBFGS and ADAM, which have mean errors of 6.03
 and 8.27, respectively.
 Examining individual datasets, BFGS achieves superior results in several
 instances.
 For example, in the AIRFOIL dataset, it records the smallest error at 0.0014,
 while LBFGS and ADAM show slightly higher errors of 0.0024 and 0.0031, respective
ly.
 On the other hand, LBFGS outperforms in the BASEBALL dataset, achieving
 the lowest error at 49.78, compared to 60.56 for BFGS and 78.73 for ADAM.
 Similarly, LBFGS demonstrates the best performance in the BL dataset with
 an error of 0.01, outperforming BFGS and ADAM, which exhibit errors of 0.016
 and 0.024, respectively.
 In the PLASTIC dataset, LBFGS again achieves the smallest error at 2.53,
 followed by BFGS with 3.27 and ADAM with 3.4.
 Conversely, in the MORTGAGE dataset, BFGS performs best, with an error
 of 0.54, while LBFGS and ADAM display larger errors of 1.54 and 2.01.
 In the STOCK dataset, BFGS also demonstrates superior performance, recording
 the lowest error at 3.4, whereas LBFGS and ADAM show significantly higher
 errors of 8.9 and 11.27, respectively.
 Certain datasets exhibit negligible differences in performance among the
 methods.
 For instance, in the CONCRETE dataset, all three methods produce identical
 errors of 0.003.
 Similarly, in the LASER dataset, the errors are nearly identical, with
 ADAM achieving 0.0025, BFGS 0.0026, and LBFGS 0.0027.
 Overall, BFGS emerges as the most effective method, delivering the lowest
 average error and consistently strong results across numerous datasets.
 LBFGS, while slightly less efficient on average, demonstrates competitive
 performance in specific datasets such as BASEBALL, BL, and PLASTIC.
 ADAM, though occasionally effective, as observed in datasets like LASER,
 shows greater variability and a higher mean error, limiting its overall
 reliability.
 In conclusion, BFGS stands out as the most robust and dependable method,
 with LBFGS showing significant potential in select contexts.

, the critical parameter p, which indicates the level of statistical significanc
e, showed no statistically significant difference between the BFGS and LBFGS
 methods, with p=0.78.
 This high value does not meet the common significance threshold (p<0.05).
 In contrast, the comparison between BFGS and ADAM revealed a statistically
 significant difference, with p=0.0017, indicating clear differentiation
 between the two methods.
 Similarly, the comparison between LBFGS and ADAM recorded p=0.0031, also
 below the significance level, proving that the two methods exhibit statisticall

, the results showed that the BFGS and LBFGS methods have no statistically
 significant difference, with p=1.0, suggesting that the two methods perform
 essentially the same regarding regression error.
 However, the comparison between BFGS and ADAM resulted in p=0.037, which
 is below the 0.05 threshold, highlighting a statistically significant difference
 favoring BFGS.
 Lastly, the comparison between LBFGS and ADAM recorded p=0.0054, confirming
 a statistically significant differentiation between these two methods as
 well.
 In summary, the results of the Wilcoxon Test demonstrate that BFGS and
 LBFGS have comparable performances in regression error, while they do not
 exhibit statistically significant differences in classification error.
 On the other hand, the differences between ADAM and the other two methods
 (BFGS and LBFGS) are statistically significant in both cases, indicating
 that ADAM shows distinct performance characteristics in both classification
 and regression error.

Summary of experimental results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In conclusion, the analysis conducted on the tables and figures of the study
 reveals significant findings regarding the performance of different machine
 learning models and parameters.
 Below is a summary of the key points of the statistical analysis.
 The analysis primarily focuses on the NEURALDE model and its performance
 compared to other optimization models (ADAM, BFGS, GENETIC, NEAT, RBF).
 Non-parametric statistical tests, such as the Wilcoxon Test, were utilized,
 which are suitable for data that do not follow a normal distribution.
 The statistically significant differences observed (
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.05$
\end_inset

) highlight the consistent superiority of NEURALDE in most cases.
 Specifically, the model achieved the lowest average error rate in both
 classifications (19.78%) and regression problems (average error of 5.56),
 consistently outperforming its competitors.
 Similarly, in the tables comparing different weight computation methods
 (MIGRANT, ADAPTIVE, RANDOM), MIGRANT demonstrated the best performance
 in classifications with an average error of 19.34%, while RANDOM excelled
 in regressions with an average error of 5.56.
 The deviations among these methods warrant further investigation regarding
 error variability across datasets.
 In parameter analysis, the 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 value (range of optimal values) and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}$
\end_inset

 (periodic local optimization parameter) appear to influence performance
 differently depending on the context.
 For example, the 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 parameter with a value of 2 achieved the lowest average error in classification
s, while for regressions, a value of 1.5 was most effective.
 Similarly, for 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}$
\end_inset

 the value of 0.02 consistently showed better performance in classifications,
 whereas 0.01 proved more effective for regressions.
 In summary, the results underline the importance of selecting the appropriate
 model and parameters based on the characteristics of the data.
 NEURALDE stands out as the most robust and efficient model, significantly
 outperforming its competitors.
 The specific parameters and methods affect overall performance and should
 be carefully evaluated to optimize the system.

\begin_layout Standard
The study focuses on the development and evaluation of the NEURALDE method,
 an innovative approach to optimizing neural network training based on Different
ial Evolution (DE).
 The results demonstrate that NEURALDE outperforms traditional optimization
 techniques such as ADAM, BFGS, GENETIC, NEAT, and RBF in both classification
 and regression tasks.
 Across a wide range of datasets, NEURALDE consistently achieved the lowest
 error rates, confirming its robustness and efficiency.
 Statistical analyses, including the Wilcoxon Test, were used to validate
 the significance of the differences between NEURALDE and other methods.
 The extremely low p-values indicate that the observed differences are not
 random but reflect the actual superiority of NEURALDE.
 Furthermore, the method proved resilient to common neural network training
 challenges, such as overfitting and entrapment in local minima.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
NEURALDE is established as a reliable and high-performance optimization
 method for machine learning applications.
 Its exceptional performance in both classification and regression, combined
 with statistical validation of its superiority, positions it as a strong
 contender for broader adoption in various machine learning applications.
 The method is particularly useful for complex datasets or scenarios where
 traditional approaches fail to deliver satisfactory results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This study opens multiple avenues for further research.
 Firstly, exploring the scalability of NEURALDE on larger and more diverse
 datasets could provide valuable insights into its generalizability and
 practical utility.
 Incorporating adaptive mechanisms within the Differential Evolution framework
 is another promising direction, as it could dynamically adjust parameters
 based on dataset characteristics, further enhancing the method’s performance.
 Another interesting avenue is applying NEURALDE to unsupervised learning
 tasks, such as clustering, to evaluate its adaptability across different
 machine learning paradigms.
 Furthermore, integrating NEURALDE with cutting-edge techniques like transfer
 learning and reinforcement learning could unlock new potential, particularly
 for real-time applications and complex decision-making environments.
 Future research could also focus on reducing the computational cost of
 the method to make it more accessible for large-scale problems.
 Overall, NEURALDE provides a robust foundation for further improvements
 and extensions, aiming to establish it as a key optimization method in
 machine learning.
